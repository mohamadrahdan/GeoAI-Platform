# GeoAI Platform
GeoAI Platform is a modular and plugin-based system for intelligent geospatial analysis and environmental monitoring.

The platform is designed to support the development of GeoAI applications by separating core functionality from domain-specific use-cases. Each use-case is implemented as an independent plugin, such as landslide detection, flood analysis, or subsidence monitoring.

GeoAI Platform combines geospatial data processing, machine learning and deep learning models, and large language model based reasoning within a single extensible framework.

## Project Status
This repository currently contains the initial project structure, core architecture, and documentation. The first development phase focuses on building a stable foundation for future GeoAI plugins and a web-based map interface.

## Roadmap
A high-level development roadmap is available in `docs/roadmap.md`.
